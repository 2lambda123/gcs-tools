GCS Tools
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/gcs-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spotify/gcs-tools)

## Raison d'Ãªtre:

Light weight wrapper that adds [Google Cloud
Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) (GCS) support to common Hadoop
tools, including
[avro-tools](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.avro/avro-tools) and
[parquet-tools](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.parquet/parquet-tools),
so that they can be used from regular workstations or laptops, outside of a
[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (GCE) instance.

It uses your existing OAuth2 credentials and allows authentication via a browser.

## Usage:

You can install the tools via our [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/spotify/homebrew-public) on Mac.

```
brew tap spotify/public
brew install gcs-avro-tools gcs-parquet-tools
avro-tools tojson <GCS_PATH>
parquet-tools cat <GCS_PATH>
```

Or build them yourself.

```
sbt assembly
java -jar avro-tools/target/scala-2.10/avro-tools-1.8.1.jar tojson <GCS_PATH>
java -jar parquet-tools/target/scala-2.10/parquet-tools-1.8.1.jar cat <GCS_PATH>
```

## How it works:

To make avro-tools and parquet-tools work with GCS we need:
- GCS connector and its dependencies
- GCS connector configuration

GCS connector is not very smart. It does not pick up your gcloud configuration,
and instead expects settings in [core-site.xml](https://github.com/spotify/gcs-tools/blob/master/shared/src/main/resources/core-site.xml),
including:

- register `fs.gs.impl`
- disable service account
- use OAuth2 by using Google's managed Cloud SDK client id/secret (this is NOT user specific)
- give dummy project id (connector will scream otherwise)
